## Using

The most common way of using this Nerves System is create a project with `mix
nerves.new` and add `mangopi` references where needed and in a similar way
to the default systems like `bbb`, etc. Then export `MIX_TARGET=mangopi`.
See the [Getting started
guide](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/getting-started.html#creating-a-new-nerves-app)
for more information.

If you need custom modifications to this system for your device, clone this
repository and update as described in [Making custom
systems](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/customizing-systems.html).


## Depedencies

* OTP 25 or higher
* libmnl-dev or equivilent 
* Nerves archive `mix archive.install hex nerves_bootstrap` [See here](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves/blob/main/docs/Installation.md)

### Example


Creating a new hello world application

```
# This assumes you have used nerves before
mix nerves.new hello_mango
cd hello_mango
echo "elixir 1.13.4-otp-25" > .tool-versions
echo "erlang 25.0.2" >> .tool-versions 
asdf install
```

Open up your `mix.exs` and update it to include

```mix.exs
{:nerves_system_mangopi_mq_pro, runtime: false, targets: :mangopi, nerves: [compile: true], git: "https://github.com/fhunleth/nerves_system_mangopi_mq_pro", branch: "main"}
```


```
export MIX_TARGET=mangopi
mix deps.get
mix firmware
mix burn
```

## Console access

The console is configured to output to the UART on pins 8 and 10 on the 40-pin
GPIO connector. This is just like the Raspberry Pi. A 3.3V FTDI cable is needed
to access the output.

## Networking

The board has two network interfaces, a WiFi module and a virtual Ethernet on
the USB C connector marked "OTG".

## Thanks

Since there aren't many RISC-V boards out, it took a bit of searching to figure
out how to bring this board up. The key was finding out that it's a trimmed down
version of the
[Nezha](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/nezha-your-first-64bit-risc-v-linux-sbc-for-iot#/)
board since it's possible to find decent device tree configurations and Linux
configurations that actually work. Everything in this repository derives from
that and not from Tina Linux. The Linux kernel comes from [smaeul's Allwinner D1
Linux fork](https://github.com/smaeul/linux/tree/d1/all/arch/riscv).
